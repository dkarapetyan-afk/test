# Tensor Operators for Tensor Network Optimization in Deep Learning

In deep learning workflows that leverage tensor networks, a range of tensor operators are applied to reshape, compress, and optimize the representation of a dataset. Below are definitions of the core operators commonly used during model construction and training.

## Tensor Contraction
Tensor contraction generalizes matrix multiplication to higher-order tensors by summing over shared indices. It merges information across connected tensor nodes, reducing dimensionality where the indices collapse. Contractions are the primary mechanism by which tensor networks propagate signals and combine features extracted from data.

## Tensor Reshaping (Reshape/Reshuffle)
Reshaping reorganizes tensor elements without changing total size, mapping a tensor to a new set of modes. In tensor networks, reshaping prepares tensors for contractions or decompositions by grouping or ungrouping physical and bond dimensions to expose the structure most conducive to optimization.

## Tensor Permutation (Transpose)
Permutation reorders tensor indices. By aligning axes appropriately, permutations reduce computational cost and ensure compatibility of tensors before contraction or decomposition. They are critical when orchestrating complex contraction sequences across a network topology.

## Tensor Decomposition (SVD/Eigendecomposition)
Tensor decomposition splits a tensor into lower-rank components. Singular value decomposition (SVD), eigen decompositions, and canonical polyadic (CP) or Tucker decompositions identify dominant subspaces that capture salient correlations in the data. Decompositions are used to compress tensors, prune redundant connections, and regularize the network.

## Tensor Factorization (Matrix Product States/TT Factorization)
Factorization expresses a high-order tensor as a product of lower-order tensors linked along new bond dimensions. Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor Train (TT) factorizations are ubiquitous in deep learning tensor networks, enabling scalable representations that preserve essential correlations while maintaining tractable parameter counts.

## Tensor Truncation (Rank Reduction)
Truncation removes small singular values or low-importance components identified during decomposition. By cutting off negligible bonds, truncation ensures the tensor network remains efficient, prevents overfitting, and adapts model capacity to the dataset.

## Tensor Normalization
Normalization rescales tensors to control numerical magnitude, typically by dividing by norms or applying layer-wise normalization schemes. Normalization stabilizes training, keeps gradients well-conditioned, and mitigates exploding or vanishing values during iterative updates.

## Tensor Gradient Operators
Gradient operators compute derivatives of tensor network outputs with respect to tensors and their interconnections. Automatic differentiation frameworks propagate gradients along the network, enabling optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent or conjugate gradient methods to update tensor parameters based on dataset loss signals.

## Tensor Slicing (Index Selection)
Slicing extracts subtensors by fixing certain indices. During optimization, slicing produces mini-batches, isolates physical indices corresponding to specific data samples, or evaluates localized structures within the network to diagnose and fine-tune model behavior.

## Tensor Kronecker and Khatri–Rao Products
Kronecker and Khatri–Rao products create composite tensors with structured correlations. These operators expand feature spaces while preserving separable structure, supporting efficient parameter sharing and enabling the construction of expressive yet factorized layers within tensor network architectures.

## Projected Entangled Pair Operators (PEPOs)
PEPOs generalize matrix product operators to higher-dimensional lattices. They encode transformations applied across the network, capturing interactions in grid-like data (e.g., images). Optimizing PEPO parameters allows deep learning models to represent complex, multi-directional correlations present in the dataset.

## Tensor Environment Operators
Environment operators approximate the influence of the surrounding network on a given tensor. By contracting all tensors except the target, the environment guides local updates that improve the global objective. Efficient environment computation is essential for variational optimization methods applied to tensor networks.

These operators collectively enable the efficient training and inference of tensor network models on real-world datasets, balancing expressiveness with computational tractability.
